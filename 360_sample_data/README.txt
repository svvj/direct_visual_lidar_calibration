# Kungsgatanparken

This is an example dataset of panoramic equirectangular images. The images where taken by [@quicksand][1] using a LG360 camera.

Note that `camera_models_overrides.json` has been added to specify that the images are equirectangular since, by default, OpenSfM did not identify them as such.  Read more in the [docs][2].
